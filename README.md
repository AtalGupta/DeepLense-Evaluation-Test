## Tasks Overview

- `TaskI_Image_Classifier.ipynb`: A notebook consist Evaluation of Task I of Image Classification of Gravitational Lensing Image
- `superresolution-3a.ipynb` & `superresolution-3b.ipynb`: Two notebooks consist of Evaluation of Task III of Super Resolution of lower resolution strong Gravitational Lensing Images.
- `TaskVII_Lenstronomy.ipynb`: Evaluation of Task VII uses lenstronomy to simulate a simple gravitational lensing effect by a point mass.
